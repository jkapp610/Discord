1. deleteChannel command will by default delete the channel that it was typed in, additionally, if you put in the wrong channel name it will also delete the channel it was typed in.
  1.a Possible add a are you sure prompt to this command to prevent accidental usage of it.
  1.b Don't allow for the user to delete a channel if there is any parameters given to the command example don't delete channel that the user is in if they type '!deltechannel general' unless they are in the general channel (To protect the user from them selves);

TEST PLAN
  TestCase: Testing Deletechannel
    InputGiven: !deletechannel
    Expected Output: remove the current channel
    Actual Output: deleted the current channel
    passed
    Notes: possibly add a way to delete the channel that the user is not currently in

  TestCase: Testing !createChannel **A VERY LONG NAME, LITERALLY**
    Inputgiven: !creatChannel THE LONG NAME;
    ExpectedOutput: Creates channel called THE VERY LONG NAME
    ActualOutput: Nothing
    failed
    Note: This didn't break the bot, but it didn't warn or inform the user of the 100 character limit of channel names

  TestCase: Testing !createChannel jim
    Inputgiven: !creatChannel jim;
    ExpectedOutput: Creates channel called jim
    ActualOutput: created a channel called jim
    pass

  TestCase: Testing !createChannel :smilyface:
    Inputgiven: !creatChannel :smilyface:;
    ExpectedOutput: Creates channel called :smilyface:
    ActualOutput: created a channel called :smilyface:
    pass

  TestCase: Testing !clear
    InputGiven: !clear -11
    ExpectedOutput: ? an error of somekind
    ActualOutput: Bot Crashed
    Failed
    Notes: I added a simple if statement to check to make sure that the input number cannot be less than 0

  TestCase: Testing !clear
    InputGiven: !clear -11
    ExpectedOutput: Error stating value cannot be less than 0
    ActualOutput: Error stating value cannot be less than 0
    pass

  TestCase: Testing !clear
    InputGiven: !clear 19999999
    ExpectedOutput: Removes everything
    ActualOutput: Bot Crashed
    Failed
    Notes: There is a limit to how many message you can delete at a time, which is 100. So I modified by previous if statement and then added an error message to make sure the input is between 0-100

  TestCase: Testing !clear
    InputGiven: !clear 19999999
    ExpectedOutput: Removes everything/error message
    ActualOutput: Error Message
    pass
    Note: while the expectation is to remove all messages, the error has been put into place because it is a limitation set by discord it self.

  TestCase: Testing !createRole
    Inputgiven: !createRole blue blue;
    ExpectedOutput: Creates role called blue with the color BLUE
    ActualOutput: blue role created with color BLUE
    pass

  TestCase: Testing !createRole for invalid color
    Inputgiven: !createRole blue cheese;
    ExpectedOutput: Error invalid color
    ActualOutput: blue is not created and error is given stating that cheese is not a color
    pass

  TestCase: Testing !createRole for a very long role name
    Inputgiven: !createRole *****alot of characters here, about 1980ish characters***** blue;
    ExpectedOutput: Creates role called the character name with the color BLUE
    ActualOutput: Nothing, the bot didn't crash either, but an error message with printed to console, but the user does not know anything about why the role was created.
    Failed
    Notes: While this did fail, I think that the only thing wrong with is that it didn't inform the user. However, I didn't change anything in the code to solve this issue

  TestCase: Testing !createRole with an emoji as the name
    Inputgiven: !createRole :Smilyface: blue;
    ExpectedOutput: Creates role called :Smilyface: with the color BLUE
    ActualOutput: :Smilyface: role created with color BLUE
    pass
    Note: didn't expect discord to like this, but it was fine with this.

  TestCase: Testing !createRole with an url as the name
    Inputgiven: !createRole url blue;
    ExpectedOutput: Creates role called url with the color BLUE
    ActualOutput: url role created with color BLUE
    pass

  TestCase: Testing !createRole with a name with various words
    Inputgiven: !createRole THE BIG blue;
    ExpectedOutput: Creates role called THE BIG with the color BLUE
    ActualOutput: Error message saying Big is not a color
    failed
    Note: This one requires a bit of logic changes to fix, but its not intended to as stated in the commands description, but it is allowed by discord.

  TestCase: Testing !help to make sure everything is consistent
    Inputgiven: !help
    ExpectedOutput: List of all the Commands
    ActualOutput: List of most of the commands and some of the commands typoed
    failed?
    Note: It worked, but the information was kinda wrong, so I ended up just adding the neccessary information
